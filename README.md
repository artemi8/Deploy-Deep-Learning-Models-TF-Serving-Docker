# Deploy-Deep-Learning-Models-TF-Serving-Docker-gRPC-REST

The dataset for TensorFlow Serving with Docker for Model Deployment is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14v42um2VRAfQPfGnBJ4QzOie4VZOPK_F/view
).

## Project Flow 
  1.We predict Amazon product ratings based on plaintext reviews.
  2.Export the Model as Protobuf
  3.Start TensorFlow Serving with Docker
  4.Setup a client (either gRPC or REST based)
  5.Run the client
  
 This is the project done from Coursera Project Network [course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/tensorflow-serving-docker-model-deployment)
